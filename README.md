### ABOUT

I applied

* the functionality of a <mark>webshop</mark>
to
* [The New York Times Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

i.e. <mark>'buying'</mark> an opinion.
<br>
<br>

### HOW IT WORKS

Selecting articles on the newsfeed adds them to the <mark>'shopping cart'</mark> â€“ the fixed bottom bar and the selected page.

<mark>'Buying'</mark> an article from your selection means <mark>'delivering'</mark> it as the headline to the newsfeed page.
<br>
<br>

* a new **API-request** from the selected _The New York Times_ **news-desk**

* **'opinion'** as keyword.

On **key-up**
