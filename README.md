# opinioned


### ABOUT

I applied

* the functionality of a **webshop**
to
* [The New York Times Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

i.e. **'buying'** an opinion.
<br>
<br>

### HOW IT WORKS

Selecting articles on the newsfeed adds them to the **'shopping cart'** â€“ the fixed bottom bar and the _selected_ page.

**'Buying'** an article from your selection means **'delivering'** it as the headline to the _newsfeed_ page.
<br>
<br>

### OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES

#### Filters
Each category on the newsfeed gets 
* a new **API-request** from the selected _The New York Times_ **news-desk** 
* with preset on Culture<br>AND<br>
* **'opinion'** as keyword.

#### Search
On **key-up** 
* **highlights** the entered text and
* **filters** the newsfeed down.

#### Recommendations
Select a **single scientific text** out of a **list of texts**
* via **ActivatedRoute**
* coming from a **JSON.**
